# Exam Generator — Project Status

> This is the authoritative rolling implementation checkpoint shared by the user, GPT, and Claude Code. Claude updates it after every successfully completed Work Package. Keep it concise, factual, and current.

## Current State

* Last completed WP: **WP-002 — Domain models and schemas**
* Current/next planned WP: **WP-003**
* Overall phase: **Fresh implementation from approved project architecture**
* Repository implementation state: **WP-002 complete**

This repository is a clean reimplementation of the Exam Generator project on a new machine.

The project architecture and product requirements have already been established and MUST NOT be redesigned merely because the implementation is starting again.

Implementation will proceed sequentially from WP-003 using Work Packages supplied by GPT.

## Implemented

* Src-layout Python package skeleton (`src/exam_generator/`).
* External YAML configuration: `config/app.yaml`, `config/llm.yaml`, `config/category_mapping.yaml`.
* Typed/validated configuration models (`exam_generator.config.models`): `PathsConfig`, `GenerationBehaviorConfig`, `AppConfig`, `LLMGenerationParams`, `LLMValidationParams`, `LLMConfig`.
* Configuration loader (`exam_generator.config.loader`): `load_app_config()`, `load_llm_config()`, `find_project_root()`, `ConfigError`. Resolves the project root by walking upward for `pyproject.toml`, so it does not depend on the process's current working directory.
* `.env.example` documenting `OPENAI_API_KEY` (no real secret committed).
* `.gitignore` excluding `.venv/`, `.env`, `data/*` (source PDFs/Excel), and generated `output/`/`index/` contents, while keeping `config/`, `prompts/`, `schemas/`, `docs/`, `src/`, `tests/`, and `.gitkeep` placeholders trackable.
* Directory placeholders: `prompts/{system,generation,validation,ingestion}/`, `schemas/`, `output/`, `index/` (empty, `.gitkeep`-tracked where needed).
* Unit tests for configuration (`tests/unit/test_config.py`), 10 tests.
* Core domain models (`src/exam_generator/models/`): `GenerationMode`, `ExamQuestion`, `CandidateQuestion`, `candidate_to_exam_question()` (question.py); `ExamRequest`, `ExamOutput` (exam.py); `SourceType`, `SourceEvidenceChunk`, `HistoricalStyleReference` (source.py); `GroundingValidationResult` (with `.passed`), `MCQValidationResult`, `CategoryValidationResult`, `QualityValidationResult`, `TextbookCheckStatus`, `TextbookCheckResult` (validation.py); `QuestionAudit`, `ExamAudit` (audit.py). Shared strict-validation helpers (bool-rejecting positive ints, non-blank text, unit-interval floats, strict bool) live in the private `_common.py`.
* JSON Schema artifacts generated from the Pydantic models via `scripts/generate_schemas.py` (no network access, deterministic, re-running produces byte-identical output): `schemas/exam_request.schema.json`, `schemas/exam_output.schema.json`, `schemas/exam_audit.schema.json`, plus a hand-written `schemas/exam_request.example.json`.
* Unit tests for all new contracts (`tests/unit/test_models.py`), 97 tests, covering every case enumerated in WP-002 section 25.

No ingestion, PDF processing, Excel processing, retrieval, embeddings, LLM integration, prompts content, generation, validation behavior, orchestration, output-file writing, or CLI functionality has been implemented yet. WP-002 implements contracts only.

## Important Interfaces

Public domain models, importable from `exam_generator.models`:

* `GenerationMode` (str enum: `STYLE_SIMILAR`, `INDEPENDENT`)
* `ExamRequest` — `{"categories": {name: count}}`, structural validation only
* `ExamQuestion` — clean external question contract (`number`, `question`, `answer1..4`, `correct_answer` 1-4, `category`)
* `CandidateQuestion` — internal pre-acceptance representation (`question`, `answers` list[4], `correct_answer`, `category`, `generation_mode`)
* `candidate_to_exam_question(candidate, number)` — deterministic conversion
* `ExamOutput` — `{"questions": [ExamQuestion, ...]}`, enforces unique contiguous `1..N` numbering
* `SourceType` (str enum: `STUDENT_SUMMARY`, `COURSE_BOOK`)
* `SourceEvidenceChunk` — `chunk_id`, `source_file`, `page` (1-based), `text`, `source_type`
* `HistoricalStyleReference` — `historical_question_id` (positive int), `category`, `question`, `answers` list[4], `correct_answer`; structurally separate from `SourceEvidenceChunk`
* `GroundingValidationResult` — `grounded`, `correct_answer_supported`, `other_answers_not_equally_correct`, `evidence_chunk_ids`, `evidence_text`, `reason`, `confidence`; centralized `.passed` property
* `MCQValidationResult`, `CategoryValidationResult`, `QualityValidationResult`, `TextbookCheckStatus` (str enum: `CONSISTENT`, `NOT_FOUND`, `POTENTIAL_CONFLICT`), `TextbookCheckResult`
* `QuestionAudit`, `ExamAudit` — per-question and top-level audit contracts

JSON Schemas (regenerate via `python scripts/generate_schemas.py`, no network access, deterministic): `schemas/exam_request.schema.json`, `schemas/exam_output.schema.json`, `schemas/exam_audit.schema.json`; example request at `schemas/exam_request.example.json`.

## Established Requirements / Decisions

The following requirements and architectural decisions already exist and remain authoritative for this fresh implementation.

### Development Model

* User: product owner / final decision maker.
* GPT: architect, specification owner, Work Package author, and implementation reviewer.
* Claude Code: implementation engineer.
* Claude implements only the currently supplied Work Package.
* GPT reviews each completed WP before the next WP is issued.
* Do not implement future Work Packages early.
* Do not silently redesign established architecture.

### Application

* Python application.
* CLI interface for V1.
* Hebrew neuroanatomy multiple-choice exam generator.
* Ingestion/indexing is separate from exam generation.
* Local searchable index for V1.
* Retrieval/RAG architecture.
* Prompts and controllable configuration live outside Python application logic.
* Runtime LLM provider/model is externally configurable and replaceable.
* Initial provider may be OpenAI/GPT.
* Application logic must not depend directly on OpenAI outside the provider implementation.
* Credentials come from environment variables and must never be committed.

### Source Authority

1. Hebrew student-summary PDFs are the authoritative factual source.
2. Every accepted generated question must be grounded in textual evidence from at least one student summary.
3. `course_book.pdf` is secondary reference/validation only and cannot independently ground a question.
4. `questions_full_export.xlsx` is historical style/structure/difficulty/terminology reference only and must not be treated as factual grounding.
5. Categories are fixed and originate from the historical workbook's `category` column.

### Question Requirements

* Questions are written in Hebrew.
* Exactly four answer choices.
* Exactly one best/correct answer.
* Natural Hebrew/English anatomical terminology conventions should be preserved.
* The correct answer must be supported by student-summary evidence.
* The question must have one unambiguously best answer based on supplied evidence.

### Generation

Generation alternates within each category between:

* `STYLE_SIMILAR`
* `INDEPENDENT`

Similarity to historical questions or other newly generated questions is allowed.

Differentiation/diversity requirements may be progressively relaxed when necessary to fulfill requested counts.

Grounding and factual-validity requirements may never be relaxed.

Core rule:

**Fail closed on factual validity; relax on stylistic diversity.**

### Validation

* Generation and validation are separate LLM operations.
* The generator's own claim that a question is grounded must never be trusted as validation.
* Grounding must be independently evaluated against retrieved student-summary evidence.
* Structured LLM outputs must be explicitly validated.

### Output

Each successful exam generation eventually produces:

* `exam_<timestamp>.json`
* `exam_<timestamp>.audit.json`

The clean exam and internal audit/traceability information remain separate.

## Important Architectural Contracts

The durable architecture is defined by:

* `docs/MASTER_PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

These documents represent approved project decisions and remain authoritative even though implementation progress has been reset.

`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` represents only the implementation state of this new repository.

If implementation convenience conflicts with an established architectural decision, Claude must report the conflict rather than silently changing the architecture.

## Decisions Made (WP-002)

* `HistoricalStyleReference.historical_question_id` is typed as a strict positive integer. This was chosen after narrowly inspecting `data/questions_full_export.xlsx`'s `id` column (header + first rows only, via a temporarily-installed, not-committed `openpyxl`, immediately uninstalled afterward) to confirm real IDs are plain positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...) — no Excel ingestion was implemented, and no new project dependency was added.
* Domain modules are split as `models/{question,exam,source,validation,audit}.py` plus a private `models/_common.py` holding shared strict-validation type aliases (`NonBlankStr`, `PositiveIntStrict`, `CorrectAnswerId`, `UnitInterval`, `StrictBool`) used across the other five modules to avoid repeating the same bool-rejection/blank-rejection logic in ~15 places.
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with one small addition: `SourceType`'s exact enum values (`STUDENT_SUMMARY`, `COURSE_BOOK`) are now spelled out under Retrieval; all other WP-002 contract decisions were already pre-documented there ahead of this implementation and matched exactly, so no other architecture edits were needed.

## Tests

* Total: **107** (10 from WP-001 + 97 from WP-002)
* Passing: **107**
* Failing: **0**

Verification commands and results:

* `.venv/bin/python --version` → `Python 3.12.3`
* `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v` → 107 passed
* `.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_schemas.py` run twice in a row → byte-identical output (deterministic).
* Serialization smoke test: built a synthetic `CandidateQuestion` with Hebrew question text and embedded `Corona radiata`, converted to `ExamQuestion`, wrapped in `ExamOutput`, serialized to JSON — Hebrew and `Corona radiata` both survived unchanged in the printed output.
* Manually inspected all three generated schema files: required fields, enum constraints, 1-based answer-ID bounds, exactly-four-answer-field structure on `ExamQuestion`, `questions` array on `ExamOutput`/`ExamAudit`, and nested audit sub-structures are all present as expected.
* `git status --short` / `git add -A --dry-run` → only WP-002 files added; no PDFs, Excel, `data/question_format.json`, `.venv/`, secrets, or generated output/index artifacts staged.

## Known Issues / Open Questions

* **Python version deviation from WP-001 spec (carried forward).** WP-001.md specified Python 3.14 and assumed a pre-existing project-local `.venv` built with it. Neither a Python 3.14 interpreter nor a pre-existing `.venv` was actually present on this machine (only system `python3` / `python3.12` = 3.12.3, confirmed via `apt list --installed` and filesystem search). Per explicit user instruction, this and WP-002 were implemented and verified against **Python 3.12.3** instead, with `pyproject.toml` declaring `requires-python = ">=3.12"`. This is a factual correction of the WP's environment assumption, not an architectural change. Later WPs/environment setup should target 3.12+ (or upgrade the machine's interpreter) rather than assuming 3.14 is available.
* No other known issues from WP-002.

## Files Added

WP-001 (carried forward, unchanged this WP):
* `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
* `config/app.yaml`, `config/llm.yaml`, `config/category_mapping.yaml`
* `src/exam_generator/__init__.py`, `src/exam_generator/config/__init__.py`, `src/exam_generator/config/models.py`, `src/exam_generator/config/loader.py`
* `tests/unit/test_config.py`
* `output/.gitkeep`, `index/.gitkeep`

WP-002 (new):
* `src/exam_generator/models/__init__.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/_common.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/question.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/exam.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/source.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/validation.py`
* `src/exam_generator/models/audit.py`
* `scripts/generate_schemas.py`
* `schemas/exam_request.schema.json`
* `schemas/exam_output.schema.json`
* `schemas/exam_audit.schema.json`
* `schemas/exam_request.example.json`
* `tests/unit/test_models.py`

## Files Significantly Modified

* `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file).
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (one addition: `SourceType` enum values spelled out under Retrieval).

## Deferred Work

Implementation roadmap:

* WP-001 Repository skeleton + configuration
* WP-002 Domain models and schemas
* WP-003 Historical Excel ingestion
* WP-004 PDF extraction
* WP-005 Chunking + indexing
* WP-006 Retrieval/category mapping
* WP-007 LLM abstraction + OpenAI provider
* WP-008 External prompt infrastructure
* WP-009 Question generation
* WP-010 Grounding validation
* WP-011 Additional MCQ/category validation
* WP-012 Textbook secondary validation
* WP-013 Diversity/retry controller
* WP-014 Exam orchestration
* WP-015 Exam + audit output
* WP-016 CLI
* WP-017 Integration tests
* WP-018 End-to-end validation

The roadmap provides architectural planning context only.

Claude must implement only the Work Package currently supplied by GPT.

## Next WP Context

WP-001 and WP-002 are complete. `src/exam_generator/config` provides configuration loading; `src/exam_generator/models` (see Important Interfaces above) provides every domain contract needed by ingestion, retrieval, generation, validation, orchestration, and output — but none of that behavior is implemented yet. In particular:

* `ExamRequest` validates request *structure* only; it does not yet check requested category names against canonical categories (that requires WP-003's historical-Excel-derived category list).
* `HistoricalStyleReference` exists as a contract, but no Excel ingestion/parsing exists yet.
* `SourceEvidenceChunk` exists as a contract, but no PDF ingestion, chunking, embeddings, indexing, or retrieval exists yet.
* All validation-result models (`GroundingValidationResult`, `MCQValidationResult`, `CategoryValidationResult`, `QualityValidationResult`, `TextbookCheckResult`) exist as contracts only; no validator logic exists yet.
* No LLM client/provider, prompts, generation, diversity/retry logic, exam orchestration, output-file writing, or CLI exists yet.

The environment's Python interpreter is 3.12.3, not 3.14 as WP-001.md assumed; see Known Issues above. The next WP's author should account for this when specifying dependencies/tooling.

Do not reconstruct implementation from memory or from another repository.

Do not copy implementation decisions that are not recorded in the approved architecture or explicitly specified by the Work Package.

The next implementation task is:

**WP-003** (per the roadmap: Historical Excel ingestion). Claude must not invent or begin WP-003's specification; wait for it to be supplied.
