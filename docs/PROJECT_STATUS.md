# Exam Generator — Project Status

> This is the authoritative rolling implementation checkpoint shared by the user, GPT, and Claude Code. Claude updates it after every successfully completed Work Package. Keep it concise, factual, and current.

## Current State

* Last completed WP: **WP-001 — Repository skeleton + configuration**
* Current/next planned WP: **WP-002**
* Overall phase: **Fresh implementation from approved project architecture**
* Repository implementation state: **WP-001 complete**

This repository is a clean reimplementation of the Exam Generator project on a new machine.

The project architecture and product requirements have already been established and MUST NOT be redesigned merely because the implementation is starting again.

Implementation will proceed sequentially from WP-002 using Work Packages supplied by GPT.

## Implemented

* Src-layout Python package skeleton (`src/exam_generator/`).
* External YAML configuration: `config/app.yaml`, `config/llm.yaml`, `config/category_mapping.yaml`.
* Typed/validated configuration models (`exam_generator.config.models`): `PathsConfig`, `GenerationBehaviorConfig`, `AppConfig`, `LLMGenerationParams`, `LLMValidationParams`, `LLMConfig`.
* Configuration loader (`exam_generator.config.loader`): `load_app_config()`, `load_llm_config()`, `find_project_root()`, `ConfigError`. Resolves the project root by walking upward for `pyproject.toml`, so it does not depend on the process's current working directory.
* `.env.example` documenting `OPENAI_API_KEY` (no real secret committed).
* `.gitignore` excluding `.venv/`, `.env`, `data/*` (source PDFs/Excel), and generated `output/`/`index/` contents, while keeping `config/`, `prompts/`, `schemas/`, `docs/`, `src/`, `tests/`, and `.gitkeep` placeholders trackable.
* Directory placeholders: `prompts/{system,generation,validation,ingestion}/`, `schemas/`, `output/`, `index/` (empty, `.gitkeep`-tracked where needed).
* Unit tests for configuration (`tests/unit/test_config.py`), 10 tests.

No ingestion, PDF processing, Excel processing, retrieval, embeddings, LLM integration, prompts content, generation, validation, orchestration, output handling, or CLI functionality has been implemented yet.

## Established Requirements / Decisions

The following requirements and architectural decisions already exist and remain authoritative for this fresh implementation.

### Development Model

* User: product owner / final decision maker.
* GPT: architect, specification owner, Work Package author, and implementation reviewer.
* Claude Code: implementation engineer.
* Claude implements only the currently supplied Work Package.
* GPT reviews each completed WP before the next WP is issued.
* Do not implement future Work Packages early.
* Do not silently redesign established architecture.

### Application

* Python application.
* CLI interface for V1.
* Hebrew neuroanatomy multiple-choice exam generator.
* Ingestion/indexing is separate from exam generation.
* Local searchable index for V1.
* Retrieval/RAG architecture.
* Prompts and controllable configuration live outside Python application logic.
* Runtime LLM provider/model is externally configurable and replaceable.
* Initial provider may be OpenAI/GPT.
* Application logic must not depend directly on OpenAI outside the provider implementation.
* Credentials come from environment variables and must never be committed.

### Source Authority

1. Hebrew student-summary PDFs are the authoritative factual source.
2. Every accepted generated question must be grounded in textual evidence from at least one student summary.
3. `course_book.pdf` is secondary reference/validation only and cannot independently ground a question.
4. `questions_full_export.xlsx` is historical style/structure/difficulty/terminology reference only and must not be treated as factual grounding.
5. Categories are fixed and originate from the historical workbook's `category` column.

### Question Requirements

* Questions are written in Hebrew.
* Exactly four answer choices.
* Exactly one best/correct answer.
* Natural Hebrew/English anatomical terminology conventions should be preserved.
* The correct answer must be supported by student-summary evidence.
* The question must have one unambiguously best answer based on supplied evidence.

### Generation

Generation alternates within each category between:

* `STYLE_SIMILAR`
* `INDEPENDENT`

Similarity to historical questions or other newly generated questions is allowed.

Differentiation/diversity requirements may be progressively relaxed when necessary to fulfill requested counts.

Grounding and factual-validity requirements may never be relaxed.

Core rule:

**Fail closed on factual validity; relax on stylistic diversity.**

### Validation

* Generation and validation are separate LLM operations.
* The generator's own claim that a question is grounded must never be trusted as validation.
* Grounding must be independently evaluated against retrieved student-summary evidence.
* Structured LLM outputs must be explicitly validated.

### Output

Each successful exam generation eventually produces:

* `exam_<timestamp>.json`
* `exam_<timestamp>.audit.json`

The clean exam and internal audit/traceability information remain separate.

## Important Architectural Contracts

The durable architecture is defined by:

* `docs/MASTER_PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

These documents represent approved project decisions and remain authoritative even though implementation progress has been reset.

`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` represents only the implementation state of this new repository.

If implementation convenience conflicts with an established architectural decision, Claude must report the conflict rather than silently changing the architecture.

## Tests

* Total: **10**
* Passing: **10**
* Failing: **0**

Verification commands and results:

* `.venv/bin/python --version` → `Python 3.12.3`
* `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v` → 10 passed
* `git status --short` → only new untracked files/directories introduced by WP-001 plus the pre-existing untracked `data/`, `docs/`, `implementation/`; no `.venv/`, `.env`, or `data/` source files (PDFs/xlsx/`question_format.json`) appear in a `git add -A --dry-run` listing.
* Manual smoke test of the public loader API (`load_app_config()`, `load_llm_config()`) succeeded and printed valid parsed values.

## Known Issues / Open Questions

* **Python version deviation from WP-001 spec.** WP-001.md specified Python 3.14 and assumed a pre-existing project-local `.venv` built with it. Neither a Python 3.14 interpreter nor a pre-existing `.venv` was actually present on this machine (only system `python3` / `python3.12` = 3.12.3, confirmed via `apt list --installed` and filesystem search). Per explicit user instruction, this WP was implemented and verified against **Python 3.12.3** instead, with `pyproject.toml` declaring `requires-python = ">=3.12"`. This is a factual correction of the WP's environment assumption, not an architectural change; all other WP-001 scope/requirements are implemented as specified. Later WPs/environment setup should target 3.12+ (or upgrade the machine's interpreter) rather than assuming 3.14 is available.

## Files Added

* `pyproject.toml`
* `.gitignore`
* `.env.example`
* `config/app.yaml`
* `config/llm.yaml`
* `config/category_mapping.yaml`
* `src/exam_generator/__init__.py`
* `src/exam_generator/config/__init__.py`
* `src/exam_generator/config/models.py`
* `src/exam_generator/config/loader.py`
* `tests/unit/test_config.py`
* `output/.gitkeep`, `index/.gitkeep` (placeholders for gitignored runtime directories)
* `prompts/system/`, `prompts/generation/`, `prompts/validation/`, `prompts/ingestion/`, `schemas/` (empty directories established for future WPs; no content added)

## Files Significantly Modified

* `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file).

## Deferred Work

Implementation roadmap:

* WP-001 Repository skeleton + configuration
* WP-002 Domain models and schemas
* WP-003 Historical Excel ingestion
* WP-004 PDF extraction
* WP-005 Chunking + indexing
* WP-006 Retrieval/category mapping
* WP-007 LLM abstraction + OpenAI provider
* WP-008 External prompt infrastructure
* WP-009 Question generation
* WP-010 Grounding validation
* WP-011 Additional MCQ/category validation
* WP-012 Textbook secondary validation
* WP-013 Diversity/retry controller
* WP-014 Exam orchestration
* WP-015 Exam + audit output
* WP-016 CLI
* WP-017 Integration tests
* WP-018 End-to-end validation

The roadmap provides architectural planning context only.

Claude must implement only the Work Package currently supplied by GPT.

## Next WP Context

WP-001 is complete. `src/exam_generator/config` provides `load_app_config()`, `load_llm_config()`, the models listed above, and `ConfigError`/`find_project_root()`. No ingestion, PDF/Excel parsing, canonical-category derivation, embeddings, indexing, LLM calls, prompt content, generation, validation, diversity/retry logic, orchestration, output writing, or CLI exists yet — all of that remains for later WPs per the roadmap below.

The environment's Python interpreter is 3.12.3, not 3.14 as WP-001.md assumed; see Known Issues above. The next WP's author should account for this when specifying dependencies/tooling.

Do not reconstruct implementation from memory or from another repository.

Do not copy implementation decisions that are not recorded in the approved architecture or explicitly specified by the Work Package.

The next implementation task is:

**WP-002** (per the roadmap: Domain models and schemas). Claude must not invent or begin WP-002's specification; wait for it to be supplied.
